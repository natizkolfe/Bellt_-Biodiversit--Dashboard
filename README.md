Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

Objective

Build an interactive dashboard with Plot.ly to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

This dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
